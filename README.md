# team-builder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<h2>This is a simple React App. In this app we load users from RandomUser Api. Here one can add a member, confirm it and show the selected members. Here we used react routing and localstorage to hold the states.</h2>
